# DevOps Projects

In this repository, I will upload my projects on DevOps and the integration of DevOps technologies with other fields like Machine Learning, Git/GitHub, etc.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Automated Web Development Environment
In this project, I have created an automated web development environment by integrating Git/GitHub, Jenkins, and the Apache Httpd Web Server on RHEL-8. The developer only needs to commit the code from their local repository. GitHub will automatically send the code to Jenkins using webhooks upon any commit, and Jenkins will automatically deploy the website to the Apache Httpd server set up on RHEL-8.



### [Project 2: Automated Website Deployment within Docker]
In this project, I have created an automated website deployment inside a Docker container. This project utilizes technologies like Git/GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker to achieve automated website deployment.

### Project 3: Containerization Within Container
In this project, I have used Docker to create an automation project that launches Docker within Docker, enabling seamless project shipping from one system to another. Docker is highly beneficial for projects that require transferring the complete project environment.

### Project 4: CI/CD DevEnv/ProductionEnv Deployment
This project focuses on continuous deployment using Git, Jenkins, and Docker, with an emphasis on automating the deployment of both development and production environments.

### Project 5: Automate CloudBuild Triggers using Terraform
In this automation, the Terraform script automatically creates a Cloud Build trigger with the defined configurations for the specified repository and deploys it to a GKE Cluster as defined in the Terraform script.
